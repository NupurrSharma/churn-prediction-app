# Customer Churn Prediction & Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end data science project that analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn, explain the predictions, and quantify the financial impact. This project is deployed as a full-stack, interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

This project tackles the critical business problem of customer churn. Instead of a static analysis, this tool provides a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for exploring historical data and a real-time prediction engine for identifying at-risk customers.

What makes this project unique is its focus on the entire data science lifecycle:
1.  **Analysis:** Understanding the "why" behind churn through a multi-tabbed, interactive dashboard.
2.  **Prediction:** Using a trained XGBoost model to predict "who" is likely to churn.
3.  **Explanation (XAI):** Integrating SHAP to explain "why" the model makes a specific prediction for an individual.
4.  **Business Impact:** Quantifying the "so what?" by calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Revenue at Risk.

## Key Features

* **ðŸ“ˆ Interactive Dashboard:** A multi-tab dashboard built with Plotly to explore churn drivers across demographics, services, contracts, and financials.
* **ðŸ¤– Real-Time Predictor:** An interactive sidebar where users can input customer details and instantly receive a churn probability score from the live XGBoost model.
* **ðŸ§  Explainable AI (XAI):** For every prediction, a SHAP force plot is generated to show which features are pushing the churn risk up or down, making the model's decisions transparent.
* **ðŸ’° Financial Impact Analysis:** The application calculates the estimated CLV for the customer profile and the specific "Revenue at Risk" to translate data insights into business value.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Plotly, Streamlit
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud, GitHub
